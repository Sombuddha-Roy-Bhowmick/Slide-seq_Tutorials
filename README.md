# Slide-seq_Tutorials
Introductory Tutorials For Slide-seq Data

Here, we will be analyzing a dataset generated using Slide-seq v2 of the mouse hippocampus.

This repository contains the pre-processing and analysis steps for Slide-seq data as well as integration of Slide-seq data with scRNA-seq data.

Please note this tutorial borrows heavily from Seuratâ€™s tutorials (https://satijalab.org/seurat/vignettes.html), so feel free to go through them in more detail.

The repository has slide_seq.R (a R script for the analysis of Slide-seq data and integration of the Slide-seq data with scRNA-seq data).

The original data (ssHippo) is freely avaialble from 10X Genomics website.

The Rscript has all the processes and steps defined with a "#", for the user's convenience.

All the image files (heatmaps, plots, and others) generated from the R script have been provided here.
